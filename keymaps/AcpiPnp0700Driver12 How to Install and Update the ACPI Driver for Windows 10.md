## What is AcpiPnp0700Driver12?
 
AcpiPnp0700Driver12 is a driver that is loaded by the Windows ACPI driver, Acpi.sys, during system startup. Acpi.sys is an inbox component of the Windows operating system that acts as the interface between the operating system and the ACPI BIOS. The ACPI BIOS is a firmware that specifies a hierarchy of ACPI namespaces in the ACPI tables to describe the hardware topology of your device. For each device described in the ACPI namespace hierarchy, Acpi.sys creates either a filter device object (filter DO) or a physical device object (PDO). A filter DO represents an ACPI bus filter and is attached to the device stack immediately above the bus driver (PDO). A PDO represents an ACPI device that is not integrated into the system board. AcpiPnp0700Driver12 is a driver that provides power management and PnP features to the device stack with these device objects[^1^].
 
An ACPI device is specified by a definition block in the system description tables in the ACPI BIOS. The set of ACPI devices varies from one hardware platform to the next, and depends on the ACPI BIOS and the configuration of the motherboard. AcpiPnp0700Driver12 is a driver that supports the basic functions of an ACPI device. To enhance the functionality of an ACPI device, the device vendor can supply a WDM function driver[^1^].
